## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

This website was based off a menu that my friends made for our Halloween party - we all had a great time then, so I wanted to make this project into a keepsake of that party :)

I've extracted the SVGs of bats using <a href="https://www.pdf2svgsnipper.com/">this tool</a> and I've removed their backgrounds using <a href="https://deeditor.com/">this site</a>
